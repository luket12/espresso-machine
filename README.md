# SoConnect Espresso Machine Interface Implementation

Despite the brief saying there were already tests written, I decided to do this project TDD as it felt like a suitable choice, having the interface available.

I started with the business rules as each test and then built the implementation and refactored as I went along.

Used some basic packages for improving dumping.

It made sense to have an Abstract class for Containers, which just contained a limit in order to keep the code DRY
